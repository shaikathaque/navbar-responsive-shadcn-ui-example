# Responsive Navbar Menu with React & Shadcn/ui

This project is intended to accompany an upcoming blog post on building a responsive navbar in React using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components. 

A deployed version is available at https://navbar-responsive-shadcn-ui-example.netlify.app.

Styling and additional functionality has been kept to a minimum in order to make the core parts of the responsive navbar more easily visible.
